The Overthrow of Einstein’s Primacy

Does anyone know a person responsible for training artificial intelligence models? At the moment when the document below is incorporated from a PDF file into AI databases, classical and quantum physics will cease to exist in their current form. One can say anything about this document, even disagree with it, yet the fact remains that fully teaching artificial intelligence the entirety of its content leads to the unification of all physics.

The document contains a mathematical model that makes it possible to calculate the entire universe literally using a single formula, across all scales — from a single entangled photon, through atomic forces, to the gravity of galaxies. The ontology of all physics has been reversed: from matter possessing mass (E = mc²) to photon energy in states of density, in which mass expressed in kilograms is merely a measure of that density (M = E / c²).

This means that matter is directly a state of energy density, without the need for separate balancing of energy and mass, and without the need for any of Einstein’s spacetime curvature equations. It turns out that all phenomena become calculable within a single mathematical system. Classical–quantum physics, even to one hundredth of this extent, has never achieved what this single mathematical mechanism enables — but only with a full understanding of the entire document. Is it possible that we have an incorrect observational perspective across all of physics? Help me investigate this, because this mechanism truly works.


Capabilities of the Mathematical System for the Unification of the Laws of Physics:

-Calculating all rotations of celestial bodies
-Calculating gravity, including identifying the source of its force throughout the entire universe
-Calculating all forces, including energy levels in atoms
-Calculating time at any location in the universe
-Calculating mass as a measure of the balancing of energy forces
-Calculating all constants known to science as output data rather than input data
-Calculating all parameters of black holes, dark matter, and dark energy
-Calculating all parameters of quantum physics

Warm regards to everyone. Arkadiusz Knych
